Notes:
Hi, my name's Andrew Fisher and I'm an interaction researcher.

Tonight I'd like to talk to you about datatium - a concept that I think about 
when using data as a material in our design and development processes - for the 
next 40 minutes.

### The web was always responsive

Notes:
What I find most interesting about responsive design is that the web actually
started fully responsive - fluidity was inherent in the way it was designed. 

---

### Then we broke it 

Notes:
But for 20 years after that though we basically systematically broke that inherent
responsiveness - mostly because of table based design but generally because
we made things work due to the monoculture of first Netscape and then IE.

---

### Then we fixed it

Notes:
Then mobile came along, and we spent a long time fixing stuff that was only
really broken because we stuffed it in the first place and over the last 18 months
we have all become converts to the idea of responsive design.

So the sum total of our last 20 years of effort has been to largely bring us
back to the point where we started.

Notes:
That's me being a little ungenerous obviously, because we do have a better
platform for design than we had 20 years ago, but I think you all appreciate the
point - we broke things due to our focus on execution for what was in front
of us, not what we could conceive of coming next.

### Forest

Notes:
And I actually worry that we're falling into the same trap again. I think we
are missing the wood for the trees.

I think we've made some fantastic technical and design achievements in the last
couple of years but I worry we're too focussed on pixels.

---

### We focus too much on size

Notes:
Or rather we're too focussed on screens. Largely we're moving from "I'm designing
this for an iPhone and a desktop" - mostly due to device fragmentation that
leads us to having this many and more screen sizes - towards "I'm designing this
for a small device or a large screen".

That's awesome and all but we're missing the underlying behaviour. These devices
are allowing computation to move to different contexts and we are changing our
behvaiour as a result. Yes it may be a small screen but it's a small screen
not on a desk in one fixed location. Context is important.

---

### Responsive design should be about me

Notes:
Responsive design at the moment is all about my device, not about me and what
I want. We spend more time reacting to whether I have a mobile and what 
orientation I'm holding it than we do thinking about the service the web
application is delivering to me.

---

## Datatium:

Notes:
To truly create interesting experiences. To truly take mobile from being just
a small screen. To truly realise the idea of a web that is responsive, we need
to think beyond pixels and start thinking about context.

Tonight, I want to talk to you about contextually responsive design and how
data can be used to facilitate it. In my work I think about data as a material - 
something I call datatium, and I'd like to share this with you so you can go
away and start designing responsive experiences as well.

---

## Agenda

1. What is contextually responsive design?
2. Using data as a material.
3. Creating contextually responsive experiences.

Notes:
To do that we'll cover off these three areas
- What is contextual design
- Data as a material and how we get it
- Creating contextually responsive experiences

Let's get cracking

---

## What is contextual design?

Notes:
Contextual design embraces the chaotic nature of behaviour. We think about intent
a lot - what is this person trying to achieve, rather than does this design
layout the right way on this device.


These experiences are ones that constantly evolve, they are highly chaotic and require you to think more about intent than about anything else. They are shaped by external factors to the user as well as to the explicit and implicit data they have generated for you.

---

### A multitude of factors

* Explicit data (What do I tell you)
* Implicit data (How do I behave)
* Extrinisic factors (What can you infer)

Notes:
Contextual design uses a combination of external factors to the person as well
as the data the person has given explicitly through actions or preference
selection and implicitly through interactions.

You need all of these components in order to be able to create a contextually
responsive experience.

---

### Missing one piece

// Voda text message

Notes:
Here's an example of an okay experience. This came from vodafone the other day
warning me I was approaching my data limit and when it would start again. 
There was one point of failure with it and the eagle-eyed amongst you may spot
it.

It hits two of the three factors:

* Explicitly I've told vodafone to contact me if I approach a threshold. So I've
expressed preference
* Implicitly I've been using my data allowance so the system knows I've exceeded
that threshold.

This is the point the message gets sent. The missing part is the extrinsic factors
 - what else can be derived from knowledge about me or my behaviour is missing
and is what turns this into only an okay experience rather than a great one.

We'll return to this example later and make it better.

### Iron man

Avengers, 2012 - Â©Marvel <!-- .element: class="attribution"-->

Notes:
Here's what a contextually responsive experience looks like in my opinion and
how seamless it can be from an experience perspective. 

Here's a clip from the first avenger's movie.

Notice here how the HUD changes from a general display on what's going on to 
full threat tactical display in a heartbeat. Stark doesn't activate it at all 
and it becomes perfectly tuned to the tactical situation around him, responding 
contextually to the threats nearby.

Most interestingly, this interface was designed with consultation from an A-10
pilot who worked with the designer on the UI and their focus on was on contextual
tactical information - notably because that's NOT how current heads up systems 
work in military aircraft.

Now clearly this HUD doesn't exist in anything other than a fictional sense but 
this completely sums up how I want the web to behave every day - and I'll 
settle for this without the flying suit of armour and pulse cannons in my hand.
